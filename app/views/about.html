    <h1>Sputnik is donationware</h1>
    <p>It means existence of this project is possible thanks to donations,<br/>and it means 2 great things to you:</p>
    <p><b>1.</b> You first install and use Sputnik, then at any moment can donate (try the same with proprietary software).</p>
    <p><b>2.</b> Price is up to you. You decide how much Sputnik is worth.<br/>It could be $15, it could be $5, it could be $0.</p>
    
    <h3>So I can donate $0?</h3>
    <p>Yes you can, but is it really how much this app is worth to you? Remember, you are not paying me, you are supporting this project to be even better in the future :)</p>
